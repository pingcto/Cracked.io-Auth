# Authentication System Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the authentication system designed for integration with the Cracked.to platform. The system is implemented in multiple programming languages, including Python, C#, Rust, Go, and C++, catering to various application environments. It ensures that only users with a valid authentication key and belonging to specific user groups (Premium+ and above) can access the application.

## Overview
The authentication system validates a user's authentication key and hardware ID (HWID) against the Cracked.io's authentication endpoint. It supports both initial authentication and subsequent verifications using a locally stored key. The system also distinguishes between regular users and those with upgraded memberships, allowing access only to those in the specified premium groups.

## System Components
- **Authentication Key**: A unique key provided by the user, used for validating their access.
- **Hardware ID (HWID)**: A unique identifier for the user's hardware, used to bind the authentication to a specific device.
- **Local Key Storage**: A file (`key.dat`) used to store the authentication key locally for subsequent access checks.

## Implementation Details
Each language-specific folder (`csharp/`, `python/`, `rust/`, `golang/`, `cpp/`) contains detailed documentation and code examples reflecting the respective implementation specifics of the authentication process.

## Security Considerations
- **Key Storage**: The local storage of the authentication key (`key.dat`) should be secured to prevent unauthorized access.
- **HWID Binding**: The use of HWID as part of the authentication process helps in binding the authentication to a specific hardware, reducing the risk of key sharing.

## Conclusion
This authentication system provides a secure method to ensure that only authorized and premium users can access the application. It leverages both local key storage and hardware-bound authentication to enhance security and user management.
