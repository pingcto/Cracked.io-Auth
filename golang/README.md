# Go Authentication Implementation

This folder contains the Go implementation of the authentication system. Go is known for its simplicity and efficiency, making it ideal for backend services such as authentication systems.

## Features
- Read and save authentication key
- Generate and verify hardware ID
- Communicate with the authentication endpoint using standard libraries
- Handle responses and manage user access efficiently

## Code Example
See `code_examples.go` for the full implementation, demonstrating how to use Go's standard libraries to manage file I/O, HTTP requests, and JSON parsing.

## Dependencies
- Standard libraries only (`net/http`, `encoding/json`, etc.)

## Security
Focuses on secure storage of authentication keys and proper handling of user credentials.

## Usage
The Go implementation is straightforward and uses goroutines for efficient concurrency management.
