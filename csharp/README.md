# C# Authentication Implementation

This folder contains the C# implementation of the authentication system. The system manages user authentication by verifying credentials against an endpoint and handling local key storage with advanced security features.

## Features
- Read and save authentication key
- Generate and verify hardware ID using the system's primary drive's volume serial number
- Communicate with the authentication endpoint
- Handle responses and manage user access

## Code Example
See `code_examples.cs` for the full implementation, illustrating the process of checking for an existing key, requesting authentication, and handling user responses.

## Dependencies
- System libraries for file I/O, web requests, and JSON parsing.

## Security
The local storage of the authentication key (`key.dat`) should be secured, and HWID generation utilizes SHA256 for enhanced security.

## Usage
The code provides an interactive prompt for new users to enter their authentication key if not previously stored.
