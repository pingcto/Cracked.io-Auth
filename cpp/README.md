# C++ Authentication Implementation

This folder contains the C++ implementation of the authentication system. C++ offers fine-grained control over system resources and is used here to handle secure authentication processes.

## Features

- Read and save authentication key
- Generate and verify hardware ID
- Communicate with the authentication endpoint using modern C++ libraries
- Handle responses and manage user access securely

## Code Example

Refer to `code_examples.cpp` for the full implementation, which includes handling file operations, making HTTP requests, and parsing JSON.

### Dependencies

- `libcurl` for HTTP requests
- `IPHLPAPI` for hardware ID generation
- `fstream` for file operations

## Security

Implements advanced techniques for secure key storage and hardware ID generation.

## Usage

The C++ code is compiled and run as a standalone executable, demonstrating high-performance authentication checks.
