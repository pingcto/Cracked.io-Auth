# Rust Authentication Implementation

This folder contains the Rust implementation of the authentication system. Rust provides a robust and safe execution environment for handling user authentication with high performance.

## Features
- Read and save authentication key
- Generate and verify hardware ID
- Communicate with the authentication endpoint asynchronously
- Handle responses and manage user access securely

## Code Example
Refer to `code_examples.rs` for a complete implementation, including async operations, error handling, and efficient processing of authentication data.

## Dependencies
- `reqwest` for HTTP requests
- `serde` for JSON serialization/deserialization
- `tokio` as the async runtime

## Security
Uses secure methods for HWID generation and ensures safe storage and retrieval of authentication keys.

## Usage
The code example is designed to be run in an async environment, illustrating state-of-the-art practices in Rust programming.
